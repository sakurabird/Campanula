## Creating Static Pages

By default, there are two static pages, `Home` and `About`, and all others are related to blog posts.<br>

### Creating Home Page

The configuration method for the `Home` page has been summarized in another article.<br>
Please take a look at:<br>

### Static Assets

First, in Next.js, there's a rule for using static assets that they should be placed in a directory named `public` directly under the root directory.<br>
For more details, please check the official website below:<br>
[Optimizing: Static Assets | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets)

`Campanula` has the directories `blog` and `stock` in the `public/images` directory.<br>
These directories are used to store images for blog posts and other pages like the home and about pages.<br>
You are free to create subdirectories or change directory names, but you must also update the paths in the front matter and `siteMetadata.js` to reflect the changes for the images.

## Creating Blog Posts

1. Create new blog posts by adding Markdown files to the `data/blog` directory. Please use the extension mdx. ex: `title-of-your-post.mdx`. The filenames of MDX files will be used as part of the URL. To avoid compatibility and encoding issues in the URL, it is recommended to use characters from the ASCII character set.

2. Add necessary frontmatter to each Markdown file, including `title`, `date`, and any other relevant information.

### Frontmatter

Each blog post must have a front matter.

Currently 9 fields are supported.

```
title: (required)
date: (required)
category: (required)
tags: (optional)
subtitle: (optional)
lastmod: (optional)
draft: (required)
metadescription: (optional)
image: (optional, if none provided defaults to `ogImage` in siteMetadata config)
```

Here's an example of a post's frontmatter:

```
---
title: "Cats: The Adorable Feline Friends"
date: "2022-02-22"
category: "Animal"
tags: ["cat"]
subtitle: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris hendrerit rhoncus risus, nec rutrum sapien sodales sit amet."
lastmod: "2023-04-23"
draft: false
metadescription: "Cats are cute, cuddly, and make great companions."
image: "/images/blog/cat.jpg"
---
```

### Deployment

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To deploy your blog to the production server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.

## Notes

- If you change the `theme` variable in siteMetadata.js, the screen will automatically switch to the light mode when you refresh the page after building. If you want to display the dark mode, please press the theme toggle button in the header.
- For cases where you have made significant changes to the file structure or renamed files and need to remove files generated by frameworks or libraries, I have prepared the command `npm run clean`. This command will not remove the source code or assets, but it will clean up generated files.
