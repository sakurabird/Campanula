These are samples of writing mathematical expressions in a markdown file using `remark-math`, a library that supports the display of mathematical expressions, etc.

Please refer to the official website below for how to use it.

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$ L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L $$

## Additional examples

$$e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$$

$$e^{i\pi} = -1$$
