Sushi is a popular Japanese dish that has become increasingly popular around the world in recent years. It is a dish that consists of bite-sized pieces of raw fish, seafood, or vegetables served on a bed of sticky rice. Sushi is often accompanied by soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger, and is usually eaten with chopsticks.

## History of Sushi

The origins of sushi can be traced back to ancient China, where fish was preserved by packing it in rice. This technique was later introduced to Japan, where it evolved into the sushi that we know today. The first sushi restaurant in Japan was opened in the 19th century, and since then, sushi has become a staple of Japanese cuisine.
