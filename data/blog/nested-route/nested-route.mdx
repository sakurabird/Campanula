Even if it doesn't match a specific path pattern, you can catch the segment and perform dynamic routing.[^1]

[^1]: [Catch-all Segments](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments)

The usage of this blog template is as follows:
By creating a directory with any desired name under the directory "/data/blog" and creating an article within it, the routing process will be automatically handled.

For example, the current displayed article is saved in a directory named "nested-route" as follows:
/data/blog/nested-route/nested-route.mdx

You can access it in the browser as follows:
/blog/nested-route/nested-route
