## Overview

The `Home` page is the default page that is displayed when you visit a website created using `Campanula`.
By updating the configuration file and creating the necessary Markdown files, you can create the `Home` page without writing any JavaScript code.
Here are the steps to create a `Home` page.

![Image of overview of the About page](/images/blog/usage-home-overview.png)

Currently, the `Home` page is composed of four sections, as shown in the above image.

- [Hero Section](#creating-hero-section)
- [Board Section](#creating-board-section)
- [List Section](#creating-list-section)
- [Posts Section](#creating-posts-section)

Please edit the `home` variable in the `data/siteMetadata.js` following the instructions below and configure the necessary settings.
Other than the `Posts Section`, the rest of the sections are not mandatory, so you can start with a minimal and simple configuration.

## Creating Hero Section

There are two display formats for the `Hero` section.

### Type1

![Image of Hero setion type1 of the home screen](/images/blog/usage-home-hero-type1.png)

The design separates text and images.

### Type2

The text is positioned in the middle of the image background.

### Set up Hero Section

Edit the `home/hero` variable in the `data/siteMetadata.js` file.

```javascript:JavaScript showLineNumbers
home: {
  hero: {
    enable: true, // required (If false, display nothing)
    type: "1", // required (1 or 2)
    title: "Tokimeki Blog", // optional (If blank, title above is used)
    description:
      "Welcome to the sample site of the blog template 'Campanula'!\n\nThis area is the Hero Section.\nPlease Update the home.hero variable\nin siteMetadata.js.", // optional (If blank, description is used)
    button: {
      enable: true, // required (If false, display nothing)
      text: "See My Projects", // If enabled required
      href: "/blog/my-project", // If enabled required
    },
    // image: '/images/stock/hero_square.png', // optional
    image: "/images/stock/hero_rectangle.png", // optional
  },
},
```

- Set `enable` to `true` to enable the Hero Section. If `false`, nothing is displayed
- Set `1` or `2` the type of the display format in `type`.
- Enter the title you want to display in the Hero Section in the `title` field. If you don't need a title, leave it as `''`.
- Enter the description you want to display in the Hero Section in the `description` field. If you don't need a description, leave it as `''`.
- You can set a button in the `Hero section`. This button can be linked to blog posts or static pages within the website or external URLs. Set `enable` to `true` to enable the button. if enabled, `text` and `href` must be specified.
- Please enter the path to the image. This field is not mandatory, but for better appearance, it is recommended to set an image.

## Creating Board Section

The `Board` Section displays content from Markdown files created for each desired theme, just like posting notices on a bulletin board.
Please follow the instructions below to configure the content to be displayed in the Board Section.

1. Create a markdown file in the `data/board` folder.
2. Please fill in the information regarding the title, whether it is a draft or not, background color, and other details in the front matter. See [Frontmatter for the Board](#frontmatter-for-the-board)
3. Edit the `home/boards` variable in the `data/siteMetadata.js` file. See [Configure the Borad section](#configure-the-board-section)

### Frontmatter for the Board

![Image of Hero setion type1 of the home screen](/images/blog/usage-home-board1.png)

Please edit the front matter of each Markdown file accordingly.

```javascript:Frontmatter showLineNumbers
---
title: "Board Section" # optional (If blank, display nothing)
draft: false # required
bgColorLight: "#D6DAFF" # optional (If blank, display default)
bgColorDark: "#1F4061" # optional (If blank, display default)
---
```

- Enter the title you want to display in the top of Board Section in the `title` field. If you don't need a title, leave it as `''`.
- Set `draft` to `false` to enable the Markdown file. If `true`, nothing is displayed
- You can set a background color for each Board. Please provide the background color in hexadecimal format for both light mode and dark mode. If you don't need to set a background color, leave it as `''`. The default color will be displayed in that case.

### Configure the Board section

Edit the `home/boards` variable in the `data/siteMetadata.js` file.
In the configuration file, write the filenames of the Markdown files in the order you want them to be displayed in the array.
If 'boards' array is empty, nothing is displayed.

```javascript:JavaScript showLineNumbers
home: {
  boards: [
    // This section displays the contents of the markdown(mdx) file. If blank, display nothing.
    {
      fileName: "board-2.mdx", // required (Please create an mdx file in the data/board directory. Please write the file name in this item.)
    },
    {
      fileName: "board-1.mdx", // required (Please create an mdx file in the data/board directory. Please write the file name in this item.)
    },
    {
      fileName: "board-3.mdx", // required (Please create an mdx file in the data/board directory. Please write the file name in this item.)
    },
  ],
},
```

## Creating List Section

The configuration method for the `List` section has been summarized in another article.
Please take a look at:

## Creating Posts Section

The `Posts` section displays the latest blog posts in descending order by date, with the specified number of posts as the upper limit.

Edit the `home/latestPosts` variable in the `data/siteMetadata.js` file.

```javascript:JavaScript showLineNumbers
home: {
  latestPosts: {
    maxCount: 9, // required
  },
},
```

- Enter the number of items you want to display in the `maxCount` field.
