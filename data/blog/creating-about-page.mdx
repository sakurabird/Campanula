## Overview

The `About` page is a static page designed for self-introductions and related information.
It can be accessed at the path `/about`.
By updating the configuration file and creating the necessary Markdown file, you can easily create the `About` page without the need to write any JavaScript code.
The steps below will guide you through the process of creating an `About` page.

## Creating the About page

![Image of the About page overview](/images/blog/usage-about-overview.png)

As depicted in the image above, the `About` page currently consists of a `Hero` section at the top and markdown file contents below.
To create your `About` page, follow these instructions:

1. In the `data/about` directory, create a markdown file for the `About` page.
You may choose to overwrite the existing `about.mdx` file provided as a sample.
2. Populate the `Hero` section with relevant information. See [Frontmatter](#frontmatter)
3. Describe the content you wish to display on the `About` page in the section below the front matter.
4. Modify the `about/fileName` variable in the `data/siteMetadata.js` file to match the filename of the markdown file you created in step 1.

### Frontmatter

In the frontmatter, you can specify the details to be displayed in the `Hero` section of your `About` page.

```javascript:Frontmatter showLineNumbers

```

- Enter the title you want to display in the `Hero` Section in the `title` field. This field is required.
- Describe in the `description` what you want to display under the `title`.  If you don't need a `description`, leave it as `''`
- You can set a button in the `Hero section`. This button can be linked to blog posts or static pages within the website or external URLs. Set `buttonEnable` to `true` to enable the button. if enabled, `buttonText` and `buttonHref` must be specified.
- Please enter the path to the image. If this field is blank, the image specified in the `avatarImage` variable in `siteMetadata.js` is displayed.
- You can set a background color for the `Hero` Section. Please provide the background color in hexadecimal format for both light mode and dark mode. If you don't need to set a background color, leave it as `''`. The default color will be displayed in that case.
