## Static Assets

First, in Next.js, there's a rule for using static assets that they should be placed in a directory named `public` directly under the root directory.
For more details, please check the official website below:
[Optimizing: Static Assets | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets)

### Directory for images

`Campanula` has the directories `blog` and `stock` in the `public/images` directory.
These directories are used to store images for blog posts and other pages like the home and about pages.
You are free to create subdirectories or change directory names, but you must also update the paths in the front matter and `siteMetadata.js` to reflect the changes for the images.
