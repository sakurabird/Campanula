## Static Assets

First, in Next.js, there's a rule for using static assets that they should be placed in a directory named `public` directly under the root directory.
For more details, please check the official website below:
[Optimizing: Static Assets | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets)

### Directory for images

`Campanula` has the directories `blog` and `stock` in the `public/images` directory.
These directories are used to store images for blog posts and other pages like the `home` and `about` pages.
You are free to create subdirectories or change directory names, but you must also update the paths in the frontmatter and `siteMetadata.js` to reflect the changes for the images.
